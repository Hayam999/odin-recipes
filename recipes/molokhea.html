        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An Egyptian recipe that is so delicious</p> 
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Mallow leaves</li>
            <li>Chicken Broth</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Ghee</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make molokhia soup, you’ll cook the minced leaves in chicken broth and
            leave it to gently simmer until it bubbles on the edges and becomes fragrant.</li>
            <li>While the soup cooks, you’ll make the tasha by pounding together the minced garlic,
            toasted coriander seeds, and a pinch of salt, then frying it in ghee.</li>
            <li>It’s essential to make sure the paste is ready to incorporate into the
            soup at the right time—when the paste becomes fragrant, crisp, and orange-hued,
             you’ll add it to the soup to give it additional depth of flavor.
            And that’s all there is to it!</li>

        <li>To gild the lily, I garnish my molokhia soup with pickled
            red onions. About an hour before I serve the molokhia,
            I combine thinly sliced red onions,
            lime juice, and distilled white vinegar in a jar.
            The pickled red onions add a vivid pop of color
            to the soup, and lend satisfying acidity. </li>
